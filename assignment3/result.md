## Generalization Experiment

In this section, you need to draw one figure
whose X-coordinate represents "the number of training scenes" and 
Y-coordinate represents "the episodic reward".

We expect two lines in the figure, showing the final training performance and 
the test performance varying with the number of training scenes. 

You can refer to the Figure 8 of the paper of  [MetaDrive paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.12674.pdf) 
to see the expected curves. [ProcGen paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/cobbe19a/cobbe19a.pdf) is also highly relevant.


Choosing one algorithm, you should train agents in `MetaDrive-Tut-[1,5,10,20,50,100]Env-v0` environments and test all agents in `MetaDrive-Tut-Test-v0`.

Please discuss the figure you get.


### The generalization curves

(20 points are given to the figure.)

[TODO]


[TODO]: Discuss the figure. Does it look normal? If not, why? Do you have any solution?




## Discussion
