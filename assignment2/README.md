# Assignment 2: Deep Q Learning and Policy Gradient



Welcome to the assignment 2 of our RL course. This assignment consists of three parts:

* Section 2: Implement Q learning in tabular setting (20 points)
* Section 3: Implement Deep Q Network with pytorch (30 points)
* Section 4: Implement policy gradient method REINFORCE with pytorch (30 points)
* Section 5: Implement policy gradient method with baseline (20 points)

We left sufficient information in the jupyter notebook so please walk through the file: `assignment2.ipynb`.



### Colab is supported

</a>

<br>


Apart from editing and training locally, you can choose to use Colab. The instruction on how to incorporate Colab into the assignment can be found in our [Colab tutorial](../colab-tutorial.md).



### Finish the assignment

Open a shell and `cd` to current directory `./assignment2` . 

Start a jupyter notebook server via `jupyter notebook`. 

Open your browser and then open the `assignment2.ipynb`. 

**We left many `[TODO]` in the file. Following the instructions in the notebook and finish all `[TODO]`.** 

Make sure your code can be run without bugs. We will run the codes by `Restart & Run All` so make sure nothing stop the running (apart from the dependencies' installation cells).




### Submit the assignment

Following the procedure to submit your work:

1. Before submitting, remember to fill your name and student ID into the table at the top of the file.
2. Run your codes in sequential manner, that is, run it by `Restart & Run All`. Remember to keep everything (printed message) intact.
3. Generate the **PDF file** via `File / Download As / pdf ` to the assignment directory.
4. Zip the assignment directory to a **ZIP file**.
5. Submit the **PDF file** and the **ZIP file** to BruinLearn.




If you find anything confusing, feel free to open an issue at Github. We will respond to you as soon as possible.
